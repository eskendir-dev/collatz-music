# ðŸŽµ Collatz Music Generator

This project turns **Collatz sequences** into music.  
The idea is simple: take a number, generate its Collatz chain, and transform every step into a musical note.  
The result is saved as a `.wav` audio file that you can listen to.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Converts any starting number into a unique melody.
- Soft and cozy sound (sine waves with harmonics and fade-in/out).
- Adjustable tempo, duration, and note mapping.
- Outputs audio in standard `.wav` format.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why?
The Collatz problem (or "3n+1 problem") is one of the most famous **unsolved problems in mathematics**.  
By turning it into sound, the project makes abstract math feel more alive, inspiring and accessible.  
Itâ€™s both an **educational tool** and a **creative experiment** at the intersection of math, music, and programming.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Install Python (>=3.9).  
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy scipy
3. Run the script:
